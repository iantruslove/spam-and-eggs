# spam-and-eggs

_Serving up tasty, tasty, fake emails._

Markov chains are a fun little toy you can use to generate text that
is complete gibberish, but kinda looks real. Using this, and some
other data generation based on somewhat real-world statistics of
emails, people, and words, you can generate emails.

The app is running at
[https://spam-and-eggs.herokuapp.com](https://spam-and-eggs.herokuapp.com).

## Usage

Start the server locally:

    lein run 8080

Deploy to Heroku:

    heroku login
    git push heroku master

Running the text file analyzer / Markov model builder:

    lein analyze <filename>

For example, this will create a `license` model that you can
immediately use to generate license-esque email text:

    lein analyze LICENSE > resources/models/license.edn
